# CPU Parallelism Performance Analysis

## Challenge:
1. Problem: sum the elements of a large array
2. Compare a naive sum implementation with a multithreaded version

## TODOs
- Experiment with different number of threads
- Vary container size
- Measure CPU utilization
- Measure thread setup time
- Plot all of this with python + matplotlib
