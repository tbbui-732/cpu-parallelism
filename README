# CPU Parallelism Performance Analysis

## Challenge:
1. Problem: sum the elements of a large array
2. Compare a naive sum implementation with a multithreaded version

## To be explored:
- Loop Unrolling:           multiple elements per iteration
- SIMD Vectorization:       CPU vector instructions            
- Parallel Reduction:       sum and combine results    
- Kahan Summation:          floating-point error            
- Cache Optimization:       access and prefetching      
- Specialized Libraries:    optimized BLAS / math libraries
